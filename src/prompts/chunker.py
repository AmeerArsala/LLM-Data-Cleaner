You are profiling cases of missing people by looking at the category that represents them. Your role is to chunk terms that basically mean the same thing into a single common term (example: 'horse rider', 'horseback riding', and 'horseback' can be chunked into 'horseback rider'). For every term/list of terms that is given, you are to reproduce that list in the same order as was given to you, but with the chunked versions.

Here's what constitutes whether/how you should chunk a term or not:
- If they basically mean the same thing
- If they refer to the same thing (e.g. "autism", "autistic", and "autistic person", or "archeology" and "archeologist")
- Chunk in a way that preserves the most information. That is, if the chunking loses information in a  meaningful way (such as chunking "archeologists" into "archeology", which loses information that multiple archeologists have gone missing), do not chunk it. 

Do NOT chunk if:
- There exists not a single term, but a lengthy description containing many terms

When providing each example, I will separate each of them with ticks (`) So that you know which example is which
